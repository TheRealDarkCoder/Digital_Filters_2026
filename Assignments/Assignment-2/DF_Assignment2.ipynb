    "# ASSIGNMENT 2: Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Many signals are easier to understand in the frequency domain than in the time domain. Examples include audio (music and speech), vibration measurements, biomedical signals, and communication signals. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) maps a finite-length discrete-time signal into a set of frequency components. In practice, the DFT answers questions such as: Which frequencies are present, how strong they are, and what their relative phases are.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use case is **spectral analysis** of audio. A musical note is not a single sine wave: it usually contains a fundamental frequency and multiple harmonics. The DFT makes these components visible as peaks in the amplitude spectrum. This is also one of the reasons why frequency-domain tools are used in audio coding, noise reduction, and music information retrieval.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DFT and FFT are closely related but not the same concept. The **DFT** is the mathematical transform. The **FFT** (Fast Fourier Transform) is a family of algorithms that compute the DFT efficiently. For an input of length N, a direct DFT computation scales on the order of N² operations, while FFT-based computation typically scales on the order of N log₂(N). In software, functions named fft compute the DFT result using an FFT algorithm. In this assignment, `np.fft.fft` returns the DFT of your signal. More info about the FFT algorithm implementation can be found in the next link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will generate a signal that contains two sine components, compute its DFT, and interpret the amplitude spectrum. You will also practice building a correct frequency axis and using **normalized frequency** when plotting spectra.\n",
